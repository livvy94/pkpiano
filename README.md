### Installation
As a C# application, PK Piano requires the .NET Framework to run. I reccomend using [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) to install the latest version.
To download the latest release, see ["Releases"](https://github.com/vince94/pkpiano/releases)
If you don't have a copy of EBMusEd, you can download it [here](https://ssl-forum-files.fobby.net/forum_attachments/0040/5149/ebmused22.zip). The source code is being hosted [here](https://github.com/PKHackers/ebmused).
